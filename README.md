# Text-GPT-p5

A text to p5.js generative editor powered by GPT-3.5 ‚ú®
1. takes plain text prompts üìù
2. makes an OpenAI GPT-3.5 call ü§ñ
2. converts them into p5.js code üå∏
3. displays the p5.js sketch üñºÔ∏è

It is also a sandbox environment for running p5.js (or any javascript code). You can make direct edits to the generated code, which re-runs the sketch immediately, similar to Glitch or Replit. 

### Under the hood

A Next.js full-stack app (React, Next API routes).

Node module(s):
